This project is a recreation of minesweeper in pygame, with the twist of using a hexagonal grid. The purpose of this project is for a school assessment.

To use the program:
1. Download it
2. Open the main file in any IDE (VS Code, Idle, etc)
3. Click run

Note: For some reason a simple double click to run in terminal does not work.

When playing, click tiles and flag possible mines.
Don't blow up.
Each revealed tile will show the number of neighbouring mines. Use this to figure out where mines are, and flag them.

Ctrl + m1 acts as m2 in game.
Clicking a tile surrounded by sufficient mines will reveal all non-flagged tiles around it.

When playing, you might see incredibly cool things, such as:
1. Minesweeper. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/057a62ed-b96e-431b-b93b-c483b7af5027)
2. More minesweeper.
3. Death to unswept mines. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2f9fc3c-9f8c-4bfc-b509-e9cc56983522)
4. Victory due to skill previously unattainable by even Lebron himself. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80e93aa7-de32-403b-8eed-80c1f18d9c02)
